Audience: Absa Bank 


Team Name

Problem
Did you know that SMEs represent about 85% of businesses in Ghana 

…and contribute about 70% to Ghana's GDP?

For such a contribution, it’s not surprising that SMEs play a significant role in Ghana’s economy 

And Absa recognizes that.

In fact, Absa views SMEs as a viable business opportunity for disbursing loans!

Yet the bank faces a number of challenges in dealing with this segment:

One, SMEs are usually a high risk group to lend to because they usually do not have collateral, do not manage their finances effectively, making it difficult to assess their credit worthiness. 

Second, SMEs shy away from dealing with banks like Absa due to the long application processes and requirements for accessing loans. 

In effect, Absa misses the opportunity to collect deposits from this critical market and the opportunity to make a sustainable impact in Ghana.

Problem: SMEs find it difficult to save and raising funds for their businesses. 
How can we open up fund access to SMEs and encourage them to save more?
How can we overcome barriers and enhance inclusivity to improve SMEs' access to financial opportunities through banks?

Improving Access to Financial Opportunities for SMEs through Banks: Overcoming Barriers and Enhancing Inclusivity


Solution
To solve this, we asked ourselves two questions: 
How to encourage SMEs to save and to increase their access to funds?
How can Absa increase deposit collection from SMEs in Ghana?
And how can we make Absa an attractive option for SMEs as a growth partner?


That’s when we created Susufy.

3 ways to solve this problem
Collective Savings
Investment
Target saving and swipe /save

Susufy addresses the challenge by enabling communities to provide monthly financial support to their members using a rotating, crowd-funded model. This approach fosters financial inclusion, strengthens social bonds, and empowers communities to meet their financial goals and needs effectively.
Susufy leverages a blockchain-based rotating, crowd-funded model to enable communities to provide monthly financial support to their members. This blockchain-powered approach fosters financial inclusion, strengthens social bonds, and empowers communities to meet their financial goals and needs effectively, all while ensuring security and transparency.
Susufy is a web application that allows SMEs to get quick access to funds to grow their businesses by joining a group of like-minded SMEs who pool funds to invest in each others’ business.

Quick access to funds
Secure investment for the future

Susufy provides Absa with:

Low-risk clients for loan disbursement 




How it Works (Product Demo)
So how does it work?
Take Abena - Abena is a fabric retailer in East Legon 
She hears about Susufy and decides to get on board 

Step 1: Abena is asked to come with 4 other business owners she trusts to simply open a group account with 0 funds
Step 2: Absa creates accounts for all 5 businesses and signs them up to Susufy
Step 3: The Susufy App randomly generates numbers for each business to determine the order in which they would each receive funds
Step 4: The App notifies all business owners of the period to make contributions
Step 5: All businesses make the contributions and the App splits the cash 50-50% and sends the pooled funds to the first person

Now let’s take a look at the Susufy Dashboard 



















Market Validation  
What is the market saying?








Why some business owners would join:
Use the cash to grow business
It’s a nice idea - another way of saving - helps the business solve a problem
Makes you get working capital quick
Would do it but it depends on the level of trust he has
Because I need working capital for my business
If I am in need of money urgently I would call on it .It’s part of savings to save more. 
The need to expand the business 
Depends on rules - When in need of money to invest in the business 
If I am in need of money for my business to grow and I can get it 



What would motivate me to join:
As long as it’s safe and can help me access funds quickly
When the bank takes responsibility for loss of fund 
Will need the trust and assurance that my money is safe and receive my cash without complain 
Make sure everyone pays - Everyone must pay their part
It should be simple and convenient - fast App
If only it’s real - they are not in for your money

Why some business owners would not join:
Some have bad intentions
Someone ran away with her money!
